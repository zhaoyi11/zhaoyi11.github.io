short_bio: > 
  <p> I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Robot Learning Lab at Imperial College London, working with Prof. Edward Johns. 
  Before joining Imperial, I was a Doctoral researcher in the Robot Learning Group at Aalto University, advised by Prof. Joni Pajarinen and Juho Kannala. 
  I hold an MSc in Robotics from Aalto University and a BEng from Huazhong University of Science and Technology. 
  In 2024, I was a visiting researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, where I worked with Prof. Dieter Büchler and Bernhard Schölkopf.
  
  <p> My research focuses on reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and planning, with an emphasis on learning versatile robot skills in a sample-efficient manner. 
  I have developed algorithms that have been applied to various domains, including locomotion, robotic manipulation, and dexterous robotic hands.
